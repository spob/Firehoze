<div class="span-12 AbleRoad partners with established organizations that are made up of professional providers, caregivers, and transition instructors who spend their entire day helping individuals with day to day mobility challenges.  The revenues generated from each video or session is shared directly with the coach who created the quality content.   What is great for the coaches is that not only do they get revenue that they otherwise might not get, but they additionally get instant feedback.  Individuals who view a video or walk through a session can provide feedback on what works and what does not on specific pieces of content.  What is great for the individual is they get access to people in other cities and locations far from their immediate support structure.
Potential partnerships structures that exist include mutual referrals and jointly-sponsored events.  We are also exploring revenue-sharing agreements, whereby all members of an association receive access to AbleRoad at a reduced per-user price.prepend-top" id="intro">
