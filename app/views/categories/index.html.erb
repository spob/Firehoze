<h3>Browse by Categories</h3>

<% for category in @categories %>
    <%= link_to category.name, category_path(category) %>
    <br/><br/>
<% end %>

I'm just putting activities here because I need a place to put it...it should go on my firehoze

<!--You'd push the following into a controller with paginate (which will help performance), but this shows basically how to do it'-->


<h3>Activity</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">
      Recent Activity
    </th>
  </tr>
  <%= render @activities %>
</table>
<%= will_paginate @activities %>
