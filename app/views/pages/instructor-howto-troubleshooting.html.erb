    <h5>Why am I receiving an error message when I upload my video, even though it's one of the supported file types?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>You might see an error such as:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Validation failed: Video is not one of the allowed file types. (content type:application/octet-stream)</em>
      </p>
      <p>if you try to upload a MOV file and Quicktime is not installed on your computer.</p>
      <p>To eliminate this you may want to either download the appropriate video player, or save your video in a format that you are able to play locally. If you are an IE user and receiving this error when trying to upload an MP4, downloading 3ivx should help eliminate the issue. Click
        <a href="http://www.3ivx.com/download/windows.html">here</a> to download.</p>

    <h5>I keep getting kicked off before my lesson has finished uploading. What should I do?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>Depending on the size of your lesson and connection speed, you may find that the site timeouts before your file
        has been able to complete the upload process. The site will currently timeout after 60 minutes. To calculate how
        long it may take for you to upload your lesson, per your file size and connection speed, go to
        <a href="http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/downloadcalculator.php">http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/downloadcalculator.php</a>.
      </p>

      <p>For example, a 62 meg file on dial-up may take almost 2.5 hours to upload but only 6 minutes on a DSL
        connection.</p>

      <p>If your download is going to take a long time, you can open a separate tab in the same browser and periodically
        navigate to other pages while your video is uploading. Doing so will ensure that your session remains alive.</p>
