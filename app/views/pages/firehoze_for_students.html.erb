<h3>“Getting an education…is like taking a drink from a fire hose”<br /> &mdash; Jerome Weisner, MIT President 1971-80</h3>

<h4>Firehoze provides short, targeted video lessons designed to complement your classroom learning experience.</h4> Face it – sometimes school can be overwhelming. Maybe you overslept and missed a lecture. Or perhaps your teacher or professor didn’t explain a concept with the clarity that you need. Or maybe a topic is hard to grasp the first time around and you need to take another run at it. That’s where Firehoze can help.

<h4>Firehoze makes it easy to find the help you need through its searchable catalog of community-generated lessons.</h4> Let’s say you are struggling to comprehend an advanced classroom topic. You can search the internet and sift through random hits that may or may not suit your needs. Or browse YouTube hunting for a relevant video amongst the dancing cats and weirdoes defending Brittany. Or you can search the Firehoze community and quickly find a short 5-to-10 minute video lesson focused on your specific topic.

<h4>Firehoze is affordable.</h4> Firehoze follows a simple model – lessons cost $0.99 and Firehoze splits the proceeds with the instructor of that lesson. You can watch a preview of  lessons for free so you can be confident that a lesson will meet your needs before you buy. You can also see ratings and read reviews by other students..  And, much like Amazon, our advanced shopping tools  let you see advanced metrics such as “What Do Students Ultimately Buy After Browsing This Lesson?” And once you buy a lesson, you can watch it as many times as you like.

<h4>Firehoze is more than a website – it’s a community.</h4> As a Firehoze user, you can engage in online discussion with instructors and other students. Join a group to collaborate with other users who share your interests. Or create your own group.  And if you can’t find a lesson that meets your needs, request a new lesson topic and watch the community respond.
