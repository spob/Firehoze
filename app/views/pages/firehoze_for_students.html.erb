<h4>AbleRoad provides short, targeted videos designed to provide you with insight into the products and services that can help you overcome your daily challenges.</h4>
<p>Face it – sometimes the rest of the world just does not get it! Many of the public and private places we experience are designed only for able bodied individuals.  Often some trivial activity, (like pushing the on-off button on a computer), is easy for someone with good eyesight and a flexible back, but for someone with an impairment, it is often feels like climbing Mount Everst.  Ableroad provides you with simple, quality how-to videos that show you, your family members, and your caregivers how to overcome these day to day challenges.</p>
<h4>AbleRoad makes it easy to find the help you need through its searchable catalog of professional and community-generated videos and ideas.</h4>
<p>Let’s say you are struggling to explain to your sisters that it is easy for you to get in and out of a car. You can search the internet and sift through random hits that may or may not suit your needs. Or you browse YouTube hunting for a relevant video amongst the dancing cats and weirdoes defending Brittany. Or you can search the AbleRoad community and quickly find a short 3 -to- 5 minute video that show exactly what your sister needs to know in how easy it is to transfer yourself from a wheelchair to a car seat.</p>
<h4>AbleRoad is affordable.</h4>
<p>AbleRoad follows a simple model – videos cost between 99 cents and ten dollars -  AbleRoad splits the proceeds with the creator of that video. You can watch a preview of a video for free so you can be confident that a session will meet your needs before you buy. You can also see ratings and read reviews by other people. And, much like Amazon, our advanced shopping tools let you see advanced metrics such as “What Do People Ultimately Buy after Browsing This Session?” Once you purchase a video, you can watch it as many times as you like.</p>
<h4>AbleRoad is more than a website – it’s a community.</H4>
<P>As an AbleRoad user, you can engage in online discussion with coaches and other participants. Join a group to collaborate with other users who share your interests. Or create your own group. And if you can’t find a session that meets your needs, request a new topic and watch the community respond.</p>
