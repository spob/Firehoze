    <h4>Beta Site</h4>
    <h5>Is this the final site?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>Ahh...no. But the functionality should be working so if any functionality doesn't seem to work, definitely let us know. You can do this a few ways – email us directly or go to the 'Feedback' tab and let us know there.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>So, why doesn't your site look very spiffy?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>Well, prioritization...and while we have superstar developers, they're still stuck by physics and that darn 24 hour day. So top priority is getting great content loaded and tagged so we wanted to get something into your hands so you only had to load content once.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Why is English my only choice in the language drop-down?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>English is just the beginning...but we're still in 'beginning' stage. Want to influence what the next languages should be? Go to our 'Feedback' button on the right of the page and vote on what you'd like to see next. And if you'd be interested in helping us translate the site into another language, we'd love to know that as well.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>What browsers are supported?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>The big ones at the moment but more to come. Firefox 3.0 and higher, InternetExplorer 6.x and higher, Safari, Chrome. Other browsers and versions may work just fine, but we don't guarantee it. If there's a browser you think we should support but don't, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

    <h4>Buying Lessons/Credits</h4>

    <h5>How do I purchase lessons from your site?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>All you need to do is by one or more credit(s) to purchase tutorials. You can easily purchase credits by clicking on the 'Purchase Credits' link in the upper right hand of your screen.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Why do you use credits?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>To make your browsing and buying experience easier. It would be a pain to have to do a full shopping cart checkout and specify your credit card each time you want to watch a lesson. Buying a bunch of credits makes it easier to quickly view lessons when you find one you want.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, also, if all credit card transactions were 99 cents each, the credit card companies would kill us on fees and we'd have to charge more for the lessons.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Where are my receipts/download history?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>You can find all of this information in your account information. Click on the <%= account_settings_link %> link at the top of the page. Then go to the 'Order History' tab to see them.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>How can I give credits to someone else?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>A gift certificate is the best and easiest way to do this.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Where are my receipts/download history?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>Your download history is stored in your account information. Click on the '<%= account_settings_link %>' at the top of the site. Then click the 'Credit History' tab.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Do credits expire?</h5>

    <div>
      <p>Credits will expire within a year if you don't log into Firehoze. All you have to do to keep your credits from expiring is log on at least once a year. Pretty simple, right?</p>
      <p>If you have credits that are about to expire, we'll warn you via email 30 days before they expire, just to remind you to log on to keep them alive.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>How do I get paid and how often?</h5>

    <div>

    <h5>Why give me the option to provide free downloads when I post a lesson?</h5>

      <p>Free downloads give you the chance to build up some ratings and reviews before users have to purchase your lesson. It can be a good way to your reputation, activity and traction on the site.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h5>I keep getting kicked off before my lesson has finished uploading. What should I do?</h5>
    <div>
      <p>Depending on the size of your lesson and connection speed, you may find that the site timeouts before your file has been able to complete the upload process. The site will currently timeout after 60 minutes. To calculate how long it may take for you to upload your lesson, per your file size and connection speed, go to <a href="http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/downloadcalculator.php">http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/downloadcalculator.php</a>.</p>

      <p>For example, a 62 meg file on dial-up may take almost 2.5 hours to upload but only 6 minutes on a DSL connection.</p>

    <h5>What are some options for recording lessons?</h5>

      <p>Best for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Those looking for something easy to use and intuitive</li>
        <li>Further editing will not be preformed as it allows for live swapping of a web cam view of the speaker with a

        <li>Limited output options -- it only allows for SWF and MP4, no compression codec option</li>
        <li>Audio can sound soft or garbled so a quiet space is needed</li>
      </ul>


      <strong><i>CamStudio (<a href="http://camstudio.org/">http://camstudio.org/</a>)</i></strong>

      <p>Best for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Those looking for features to support a higher level of video production</li>
        <li>Desire to do further editing of captured video</li>

        <li>More expansive feature set – codec choice, intelligent capture moving the frame to follow the cursor during
          capture
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interface isn't terribly pretty</li>
        <li>Additional features can make for a slower learning curve</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Pros:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Free</li>
        <li>No software to download</li>
        <li>More intelligent audio than Jing – allows the user to select a target playback rate and redub the audio post
          capture
        </li>
        <li>Captures live from a webcam and show the video as a picture in picture in the corner of the screen capture.</li>
        <li>Output to .mov (QuickTime)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons</p>
