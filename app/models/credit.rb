# A credit can be redeemed to allow a user to download a video.
#
# A credit is considered available if it has not yet been redeemed, or used to
# view a video.
# Once a credit is redeemed, the redeemed_at field will be populated with the date when it
# was redeemed, and it will be associated to a lesson.
# A credit also stores information about when it was purchased (acquired_at), and the price
# for which is was purchased.
# The user is the user to whom this credit belongs.
#
# Redeemed credits represents a history of which videos have been purchased by which users.
